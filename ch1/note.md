### 1.4.2 Queuing Delay and Packet Loss

a: the average rate(in units of packets/sec) at which packets arrive at the queue.
R: the transmission rate(in bits/sec), at which bits are pushed out of the queue.
L: packets size.

  1. La  : bits/sec
  2. La/R: traffic intensity
  3. L/R : one packet transmission time. If packet arrives every L/R seconds, then every packet will arrive at an empty queue and there will be no queue delay.
  4. (L/R)N:
