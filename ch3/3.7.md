When there is excessive congestion, then one (or more) router buffers
along the path overflows, causing a datagram (containing a TCP segment) to be
dropped. The dropped datagram, in turn, results in a loss event at the sender—either
a timeout or the receipt of three duplicate ACKs—which is taken by the sender to be
an indication of congestion on the sender-to-receiver path.
