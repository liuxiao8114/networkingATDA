## 3.5 Connection-Oriented Transport: TCP
### 3.5.2 TCP Segment Structure
              32-bit
ACK

### 3.5.4 Reliable Data Transfer
In our earlier development of reliable data transfer techniques, it was conceptually easiest to assume that an individual timer is associated with each transmitted but not yet acknowledged segment.

#### Doubling the Timeout Interval
whenever the timeout event occurs, TCP retransmits the not-yet-acknowledged segement with the smallest sequence number.
Each time TCP retransmits, 
#### Fast Retransmit
A duplicate ACK is an ACK that reacknowledges a segment for which the sender has already recevied an earlier acknowledgement.
