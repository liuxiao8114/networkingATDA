The transport layer in the receiving host does not actually deliver data directly to a process, but instead to an intermediary socket.

At the receiving end, the transport layer examines these fields to identify the receiving socket and then directs the segment to that socket.

The TCP server application has a “welcoming socket,” that waits for connectionestablishment

requests from TCP clients (see Figure 2.29) on port number 12000.

• The TCP client creates a socket and sends a connection establishment request
segment with the lines:
  clientSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
  clientSocket.connect((serverName,12000))

• A connection-establishment request is nothing more than a TCP segment with
destination port number 12000 and a special connection-establishment bit set in
the TCP header (discussed in Section 3.5). The segment also includes a source
port number that was chosen by the client.
• When the host operating system of the computer running the server process
receives the incoming connection-request segment with destination port 12000,
it locates the server process that is waiting to accept a connection on port number 12000. The server process then creates a new socket:
  connectionSocket, addr = serverSocket.accept()
