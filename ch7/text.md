## 7.3 Wireless LANs
the IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN, also known as WiFi.

The standards have some major differences at the physical layer. 802.11 devices operate
in to different frequency ranges: 2.4-2.485GHz and 5.1-5.8GHz


### 7.3.1 The 802.11 Wireless LAN Architecture
The fundamental building block of the 802.11 architecture is the *basic service set(BSS)*.
A BSS contains one or more wireless stations and a central *base station*.

wireless LANs that deploy APs are often referred to as *infrastructure wireless LANs*, with the "infrastructure" being the APs along with the wired Ethernet infrastructure that interconnects the APs and a router.
IEEE 802.11 stations can also group themselves together to form an ad hoc network--a network with no central control and with no connections to the "outside world".
